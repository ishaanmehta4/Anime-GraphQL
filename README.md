# Anime-GraphQL
A GraphQL API that provides data about anime and anime characters, build using express-graphql for backend, and apollo-client with ReactJS for frontend.

The data is fetched at runtime using web-scraping from [www.animecharactersdatabase.com](https://www.animecharactersdatabase.com/).

REST routes are also available :)
